**Given two algorithms for a task, how do we find out which one is better?**

A naive approach is to implement both algorithms and compare their running times on different inputs, but this method has many drawbacks for analyzing algorithms. 

It might be possible that for some **inputs**, the first algorithm performs better than the second. And for some **inputs** second performs better. 
It might also be possible that for some inputs, the first algorithm performs better on one **machine**, and the second works better on another **machine** for some other inputs.
Asymptotic analysis evaluates an algorithm’s performance based on input size, ignoring actual running time. It measures the order of growth of time or space; for example, linear search grows linearly, while binary search grows logarithmically.

**For example:** Let us consider the search problem (searching a given item) in a sorted array. 

The solution to above search problem includes: 

- **Linear Search** (order of growth is linear) 
- **Binary Search** (order of growth is logarithmic).

To understand how Asymptotic Analysis solves the problems mentioned above in analyzing algorithms, 

- Suppose we run Linear Search on computer A (faster) and Binary Search on computer B (slower).
- For small input sizes, Linear Search may take less time because computer A is faster.
- As the input size increases, Binary Search eventually becomes faster, even on the slower computer B.
- This happens because Linear Search grows linearly, while Binary Search grows logarithmically with input size.
- After a certain input size, machine-dependent constants (e.g., A being 5000× faster than B) no longer matter.
- Asymptotic analysis focuses on this growth, allowing us to compare algorithms independent of machine speed for large inputs.

| Input Size | Running time on A | Running time on B |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 10         | 2 sec             | ~ 1 h             |
| 100        | 20 sec            | ~ 1.8 h           |
| 10^6       | ~ 55.5 h          | ~ 5.5 h           |
| 10^9       | ~ 6.3 years       | ~ 8.3 h           |

Running times for this example: 
- Linear Search running time in seconds on A: $0.2 * n$ 
- Binary Search running time in seconds on B: $1000*log(n)$ 

**Does Asymptotic Analysis always work?**
- Asymptotic analysis is the best general method for analyzing algorithms, even though it is not perfect.
- It ignores constant factors, so two algorithms with the same asymptotic complexity (e.g., $$1000n*log ⁡n$ vs $2n*log⁡ n$) cannot be directly compared for practical speed.
- Asymptotic analysis focuses on large input sizes, but in real applications, these inputs may never occur.
- An algorithm that is asymptotically slower can perform better for specific inputs, so practical performance may lead to choosing it over a theoretically faster algorithm.
